# awesome-papers
My own collection of useful (or not) papers about algorithms, optimization, machine learning, graphics, programming languages, etc

Pool requests are welcomed

(Sorry for my poor English)

#Machine learning
## SVM
- An Idiotâ€™s guide to Support vector machines (SVMs) - nice but too brief introduction into SVM

- Support Vector and Kernel Machines - yet another brief SVM tutorial

- A Gentle Introduction to Support Vector Machines in Biomedicine - good survey to different applications of SVM

- http://efavdb.com/svm-classification/ - small but nice tutorial with derivation of Dual Problem and recomendations for SVM usage

- A Practical Guide to Support Vector Classification - a practical guide to support vector classifivation (lol)

- Pegasos: Primal Estimated sub-GrAdient SOlver for SVM - description of good SGD based SVM learning algorithm with good theorethical properties

- Training a Support Vector Machine in the Primal - algorithm for solving primal version of SVM problem via smooth loss and Newton algorithm.

##SGD

- large-scale machine learning revisited - good justification why SGD outperforms traditional approaches

- Large-Scale Machine Learning with Stochastic Gradient Descent - brief introduction of SGD


#Optimization

##Conjugate gradient method

- An Introduction to the Conjugate Gradient Method Without the Agonizing Pain - maybe best paper about optimization algorithm which i ever seen

##Automatic Differentiation

- http://alexey.radul.name/ideas/2013/introduction-to-automatic-differentiation/ - good AD digest without tech details

- http://h2.jaguarpaw.co.uk/posts/reverse-mode-automatic-differentiation/ - nice implementation of reverse mode autodiff via Haskell

#Math

##Linear algebra

- Matrix Algebra Theory, Computations, and Applications in Statistics - just good book

#Geometry

##SLAM

- CURVESLAM: UTILIZING HIGHER LEVEL STRUCTURE IN STEREO VISION-BASED NAVIGATION. - good list of 3d curve 2 image fitting
